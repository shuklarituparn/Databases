SELECT
	first_name,
        last_name
FROM
	customer
WHERE
	first_name LIKE 'Jen%';
	
	
Notice that the WHERE clause contains a special expression: the first_name, the LIKE operator and a string that contains a percent sign (%). The string 'Jen%' is called a pattern.	


    Percent sign ( %) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
    Underscore sign ( _)  matches any single character.
    
 value LIKE pattern //Like keyword
 
 value NOT LIKE pattern //Not like
 
 
 SELECT

WHERE
	first_name ILIKE 'BAR%'; //Same like "LIKE" just considers case matching

ORDER BY
