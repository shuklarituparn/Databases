The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

The following illustrates the syntax of the UNION operator that combines result sets from two queries:


SELECT select_list_1
FROM table_expresssion_1
UNION
SELECT select_list_2
FROM table_expression_2


SELECT * FROM top_rated_films
UNION ALL                        //this will show even the duplicate films
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films;


SELECT * FROM top_rated_films
UNION                               //this will remove the duplicate entries from the list
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films;


//we can also add ORDER BY to sort it
