A column alias allows you to assign a column or an expression in the select list of a SELECT statement a temporary name. The column alias exists temporarily during the execution of the query.

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;


SELECT 
   first_name, 
   last_name surname
FROM customer;   //removing the AS keyword before the surname part


SELECT
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM
    customer;
    


column_name AS "column alias" //If alias contains space needed to use a double quote


SELECT 
   first_name, 
   last_name surname   //it doesn't have a comma
FROM 
	customer;
	

SELECT 
   first_name as ИМЯ, 
   last_name Фамилия
FROM 
	customer;
