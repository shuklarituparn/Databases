You use the BETWEEN operator to match a value against a range of values. The following illustrates the syntax of the BETWEEN operator:


value BETWEEN low AND high;  //to check for a value between two values


value >= low and value <= high  //Rewriting the between operator using <= and >= 



value NOT BETWEEN low AND high; //To check if the value id in some range


value < low OR value > high



SELECT 
	customer_id,
	payment_id,
	amount
FROM 
	payment
WHERE 
	amount NOT BETWEEN 8 AND 9 All the amount that is not between 8 and 9
	
	

SELECT 
	customer_id,
	payment_id,
	amount
FROM 
	payment
	
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2007-02-07' AND '2007-02-15'; //All the data where the payment date is between those two dates
