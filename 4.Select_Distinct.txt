SELECT DISTINCT clause is used to remove duplicate rows from a result set returned by a query.

Introduction to PostgreSQL SELECT DISTINCT clause

The DISTINCT clause is used in the SELECT statement to remove duplicate rows from a result set. 

The DISTINCT clause keeps one row for each group of duplicates. The DISTINCTclause can be applied to one or more columns in the select list of the SELECT statement.


SELECT
   DISTINCT column1
FROM
   table_name;
   
   
If you specify multiple columns, the DISTINCT clause will evaluate the duplicate based on the combination of values of these columns.

SELECT
   DISTINCT column1, column2
FROM
   table_name;

PostgreSQL also provides the DISTINCT ON (expression) to keep the “first” row of each group of duplicates using the following syntax:

SELECT
   DISTINCT ON (column1) column_alias,
   column2
FROM
   table_name
ORDER BY
   column1,
   column2;
  
//TO USE DISTINCT WE'LL USE THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE

CREATE TABLE distinct_demo (
	id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, //Serial will be the primary key
	bcolor VARCHAR, 
	fcolor VARCHAR
);  



insert into distinct_demo (bcolor, fcolor)

values
	('red', 'red'),
	('red', 'red'),
	('red', 'NULL'),
	('NULL', 'red'),
	('red', 'green'),
	('red', 'blue'),
	('green', 'red'),
	('green', 'blue'),
	('green', 'green'),
	('blue', 'red'),
	('blue', 'green'),
	('blue', 'blue'); //we enter using quotes as we have VARCHAR
	
	
//Inorder to show the distinct row use the DISTINCT keyword

SELECT
	DISTINCT bcolor
	
FROM
	distinct_demo

ORDER BY
	bcolor;
	
	
//Distinct clause on Multiple columns

SELECT
	DISTINCT bcolor,
	fcolor
FROM
	distinct_demo
ORDER BY
	bcolor,
	fcolor;


SELECT
	DISTINCT ON (bcolor) bcolor, //storing the first for each duplicates
	fcolor
FROM
	distinct_demo 
ORDER BY
	bcolor,
	fcolor;
