Introduction to PostgreSQL INTERSECT operator

Like the UNION and EXCEPT operators, the PostgreSQL INTERSECT operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

The INTERSECT operator returns any rows that are available in both result sets.

The following illustration shows the final result set produced by the INTERSECT operator.



SELECT select_list
FROM A
INTERSECT
SELECT select_list
FROM B;

The number of columns and their order in the SELECT clauses must be the same.
The data types of the columns must be compatible



SELECT select_list
FROM A
INTERSECT
SELECT select_list
FROM B
ORDER BY sort_expression;



select *
from most_popular_films

intersect

select *

from top_rated_films   //Returning the common element from both the tables
