The SELECT statement is one of the most complex statements in PostgreSQL. It has many clauses that you can use to form a flexible query.

Because of its complexity, we will break it down into many shorter and easy-to-understand tutorials so that you can learn about each clause faster.

The SELECTstatement has the following clauses:

    Select distinct rows using DISTINCT operator.
    Sort rows using ORDER BY clause.
    Filter rows using WHERE clause.
    Select a subset of rows from a table using LIMIT or FETCH clause.
    Group rows into groups using GROUP BY clause.
    Filter groups using HAVING clause.
    Join with other tables using joins such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN clauses.
    Perform set operations using UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.
