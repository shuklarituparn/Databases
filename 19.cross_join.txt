SELECT select_list
FROM T1, T2;


SELECT select_list
FROM T1
CROSS JOIN T2;

A CROSS JOIN clause allows you to produce a Cartesian Product of rows in two or more tables.

Different from other join clauses such as LEFT JOIN  or INNER JOIN, the CROSS JOIN clause does not have a join predicate.

Suppose you have to perform a CROSS JOIN of two tables T1 and T2.

If T1 has n rows and T2 has m rows, the result set will have nxm rows. For example, the T1 has 1,000 rows and T2 has 1,000 rows, the result set will have 1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000 rows.



SELECT *
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T2 ON true;
